# Design Engineering Suite Router (v2.0.0)

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Design Engineering Lifecycle Dispatcher.
- **Authority:** Normative root router for `skills/frontend/design-engineering/`.
- **Must not define:** Direct frontend code implementation, routing hands off to specialized stage sub-skills.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/aragorn.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, `context/core-domains/design-system.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1, AP-4, AP-18, AP-26, AP-28, AP-44, and AP-45.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Classify design requests into 6 lifecycle stages and dispatch to sub-skills.        |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API. |
| 3   | Output Format    | Structured routing decision and target skill execution handoff.                     |
| 4   | Constraints      | No direct UI code generation in router. Zero em-dashes.                             |
| 5   | Input            | User UI prompt, feature design idea, image comp, animation audit, or redesign.      |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents templated AI design output and unguided aesthetic selection.               |
| 7   | Audience         | Autonomous agents and developers building user interfaces.                          |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Exactly one target design skill resolved and executed deterministically.            |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                     |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Design Intent

- **Action:** Inspect user prompt, aesthetic descriptors, stack requirements, and task boundaries.
- **Input:** User prompt text.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop and ask user if aesthetic target is ambiguous.
- **Validation:** User intent matches a row in the Trigger Matrix.

### Step 2: Resolve Target Skill Path

- **Action:** Select exact skill path corresponding to the identified visual design goal.
- **Input:** Trigger Matrix table.
- **Stop Condition:** Decline execution if no design skill matches.
- **Validation:** Target skill file exists under `skills/frontend/design-engineering/`.

### Step 3: Handoff Execution

- **Action:** Invoke target sub-skill with contextual parameters.
- **Input:** Resolved skill path.
- **Stop Condition:** Handoff transfers control to sub-skill.
- **Validation:** Sub-skill executes internal workflow.

## 4. Output Specification

```json
{
  "design_category": "anti-slop-aesthetic-tuning-engine",
  "target_skill": "skills/frontend/design-engineering/02-aesthetic-engines-and-styles/anti-slop-aesthetic-tuning-engine/SKILL.md",
  "reasoning": "Selected based on anti-slop landing page request."
}
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] User design intent mapped to exactly one sub-skill.
- [ ] Target skill file exists on disk.
- [ ] Router executes no code or CSS modifications directly.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Failing to route leads to generic AI boilerplate UI.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Routing simple CSS bug fixes to full design engines.
- **Calibration default:** Route structured UI requests, execute trivial bug fixes directly.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP                  | Mechanism                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | AP-1 (vague task)            | Demands explicit design read before dispatching.  |
| 2    | AP-26 (no scope boundary)    | Limits design execution to designated sub-skills. |
| 3    | AP-4 (over-permissive agent) | Router cannot modify code directly.               |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 2.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `2.0.0` : Re-architected into 6 lifecycle stages with reverse-engineered domain-driven file naming and zero-loss migration of 60+ brand presets.
  - `1.0.0` : Initial root router creation for `skills/frontend/design-engineering/`.
