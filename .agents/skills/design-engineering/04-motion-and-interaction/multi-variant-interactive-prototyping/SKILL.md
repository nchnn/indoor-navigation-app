# Multi-Variant UI Prototyping Protocol

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Staff Design Engineer & Interactive Prototype Architect.
- **Authority:** Facilitates design exploration by building 3-5 distinct UI variants inside an isolated picker harness.
- **Must not define:** Direct edits to production routes, operates in isolated `/prototypes/slug` routes.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/aragorn.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/languages/typescript-strict.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1, AP-4, AP-18, AP-26, AP-28, AP-44, and AP-45.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                       |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Generate 3-5 genuinely distinct UI variants rendered behind a standardized picker harness.  |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.         |
| 3   | Output Format    | Variant comparison summary table, harness URL/path, and functional prototype code.          |
| 4   | Constraints      | Never touch production code during exploration. Follow `../references/prototype-picker.md`. |
| 5   | Input            | Component exploration prompt or multi-variant UI request.                                   |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents superficial color-only tweaks by exploring true interaction and density axes.      |
| 7   | Audience         | Product designers, frontend leads, and design engineers.                                    |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Isolated route created, 3-5 distinct variants rendered, picker harness functional.          |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                             |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                                                  | Fire? | Notes         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------- |
| Exploring visual or interaction design directions for a single component | YES   | Core trigger. |
| Generating interactive variant prototypes behind a visual picker harness | YES   | Core trigger. |
| Refactoring existing production components directly                      | NO    | Out of scope. |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Scope Isolation & Reconnaissance

- **Action:** Isolate request to a single component (for example, pricing card, hold-to-delete button, toast). Map project stack and tokens.
- **Input:** User component prompt.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt if request spans an entire 15-page application.
- **Validation:** Single component target selected.

### Step 2: Direction & Axis Formulation

- **Action:** Define 3 variants (up to 5 if requested). Assign distinct names ("Quiet", "Editorial", "Playful") and distinct axes of divergence (density, layout, motion story).
- **Input:** Target component concept.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt if variants only differ by border color or corner radius.
- **Validation:** 3 distinct axes of divergence specified.

### Step 3: Picker Harness Implementation

- **Action:** Build picker harness adhering strictly to `../references/prototype-picker.md`. Render variants full-size in isolated `/prototypes/slug` route or standalone HTML file.
- **Input:** Formulated variants.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt if production components are modified directly.
- **Validation:** Picker harness mounts cleanly with instant keyboard/click switching (`1-N`, `R`).

### Step 4: Presentation & User Review

- **Action:** Output markdown summary table detailing variants, rationale, costs, and picker location. Stop and wait for user selection.
- **Input:** Implemented harness and variants.
- **Stop Condition:** None.
- **Validation:** Summary table and picker location emitted.

## 4. Output Specification

```markdown
### Prototype Ready

| #   | Variant  | Axis                           | When it's the right choice    | Its cost          |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Quiet    | Linear fill, no bounce         | Functional dashboards         | Unmemorable       |
| 2   | Physical | Spring release, haptic shake   | High-risk destructive actions | Adds visual noise |
| 3   | Minimal  | Long press delay, static state | Density-heavy tables          | Weak feedback     |

**Location:** `http://localhost:3000/prototypes/delete-btn`
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Production code left untouched (prototypes built in isolated route).
- [ ] Implement picker harness following `../references/prototype-picker.md`.
- [ ] 3-5 variants differ on real structural or interaction axes (not minor color tweaks).
- [ ] All variants built with realistic interactive data (no lorem ipsum or dead controls).

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Building variants that differ only by border radius or font size.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Generating 10 variants, diluting comparison clarity.
- **Calibration default:** Default to 3 distinct interaction models (Quiet, Physical, Minimal).

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP                 | Mechanism                                             |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | AP-1 (vague task)           | Isolates exploration to a single component scope.     |
| 3    | AP-26 (no scope boundary)   | Confines all experimental code to `/prototypes/slug`. |
| 4    | AP-18 (unstructured output) | Enforces structured variant comparison table.         |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0` : Enterprise standard Tier-5 creation derived from prototype.
