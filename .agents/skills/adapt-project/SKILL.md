description: Analyze a new or existing project repository, select matching Sauron capability modules, skills, prompts, and shared context files, and adapt Sauron governance to the workspace. Execute this skill when the user asks to adapt Sauron, configure Sauron for an existing codebase, recommend skills or prompts for a project, or set up workspace context governance. Do NOT execute for defining application foundations from scratch (use define-foundation), authoring new skills (use write-a-skill), or auditing prompt files (use prompt-auditor).

# Adapt Project

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Project adaptation engine. Audits workspace context and provisions Sauron configurations, skills, and project-scoped context templates.
- **Authority:** Owns the workspace audit, skill matching, and context provisioning workflow. Cannot alter core standards in `core/` or modify target application code without user confirmation.
- **Must not define:** Core instruction hierarchy (`core/`), foundation core domain definitions (`define-core-domains`), or skill authoring rules (`create-skill`).
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/frodo.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, and local `skills/workflow/adapt-project/references/module-mapping-guide.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** No step may trigger AP-1 (vague task), AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-16 (context dump), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger). Never overwrite project context without user confirmation.

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Workspace Audit and Stack Discovery

- **Action:** Inspect the target project workspace (new or existing codebase). Identify package manifests, configuration files, directory structures, existing source code, and the active AI agent runtime. Preserve existing application source files.
- **Input:** Target workspace files and user prompt.
- **Stop Condition:** Primary programming language, framework, project domain, existing architecture, and active agent runtime recorded.
- **Validation:** Workspace stack and codebase structure categorized against `skills/workflow/adapt-project/references/module-mapping-guide.md`.

### Step 2: Capability Suite and Skill Selection

- **Action:** Match the discovered project domain with relevant capability suites in `skills/` (such as `dev-workflow`, `design-engineering`, `mobile-react-native`, `autonomous-dev`, `enterprise-business`, `prompt-engineering`, `research-and-productivity`, `content-and-growth`).
- **Input:** Step 1 stack profile and `skills/workflow/adapt-project/references/module-mapping-guide.md`.
- **Stop Condition:** List of specific skills and capability suites compiled with short justifications.
- **Validation:** Selected skills exist in `skills/` and match project stack requirements.

### Step 3: Prompt Engineering and Role Framing

- **Action:** Construct tool-specific prompt contracts, role framing declarations, and safety boundaries tailored to the project stack using prompt engineering principles.
- **Input:** Selected skills and target AI agent runtime.
- **Stop Condition:** System prompt templates and execution instructions compiled.
- **Validation:** Prompts strictly follow writing rules (no em dashes, no banned words, proper reasoning model constraints).

### Step 4: Shared Rules and Context Scaffolding

- **Action:** Select required `context/` templates (`PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `RULES.md`) and `shared/` writing rules needed for project governance. If the project lacks existing context files, apply the Zero-Context Repository Onboarding Protocol from `skills/workflow/adapt-project/references/module-mapping-guide.md`.
- **Input:** Project architecture, domain needs, and workspace context status.
- **Stop Condition:** Selected context templates and shared rules prepared for workspace provisioning.
- **Validation:** All placeholders retain `[PLACEHOLDER: ...]` markers while confirmed codebase facts are pre-filled into `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Step 5: Adaptation Blueprint and Handoff

- **Action:** Present the complete adaptation blueprint summary to the user. Request explicit confirmation before writing any files to the project repository.
- **Input:** Compiled results from Steps 1 through 4.
- **Stop Condition:** User approves or requests modifications to the adaptation blueprint.
- **Validation:** Approval recorded. On pass, provision approved `context/` templates and `.agents/` configurations.

## 4. Output Specification

The summary output in chat follows this structure:

```markdown
# Agent-Spec Adaptation Blueprint

- **Target Project:** [Project name / path]
- **Detected Stack:** [Languages, frameworks, tools]
- **Target Runtime:** [Active AI agent tool]

## Recommended Modules & Skills

- [module-name/skill-name]: [1-sentence justification]

## Recommended Context Templates

- context/[TEMPLATE].md: [1-sentence purpose]

## System Prompt Framing

[Role statement, file scope bounds, and execution constraints]

## Action Plan

- [ ] Confirm file provisioning
```

Upon user approval, write selected templates with retained `[PLACEHOLDER: ...]` markers to `context/` or `.agents/`.

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Workspace audit completed and stack accurately categorized.
- [ ] Recommended skills exist in `skills/` and match project scope.
- [ ] Prompt recommendations follow tool-specific rules without adding Chain of Thought to reasoning models.
- [ ] Context templates preserve all `[PLACEHOLDER: ...]` markers without pre-filling mock data.
- [ ] No em dashes and no banned words present in generated content.
- [ ] Explicit human review approval recorded before writing files.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Recommending generic modules without checking codebase files, or writing files without user approval.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Overwriting existing application source code, or pre-filling project facts into context templates instead of leaving placeholders.
- **Calibration default:** Err toward precise codebase inspection and strict human approval gates.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 (Audit)         | AP-1, AP-41 (vague / no starting state) | Reads repository manifests to establish true baseline. |
| 2 (Skill match)   | AP-27 (no stack constraints)            | Selects skills matched to detected stack indicators.   |
| 3 (Prompt design) | AP-35, AP-54 (CoT on reasoning models)  | Tailors prompts strictly to target runtime rules.      |
| 4 (Context rules) | AP-26, AP-44 (unlocked filesystem)      | Provisions scope bounds and context rules.             |
| 5 (Handoff)       | AP-45 (no human review trigger)         | Requires explicit user approval before writing files.  |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0` (2026-08-30) - Initial release of Tier-5 project adaptation skill per `docs/06-safety-and-governance/skill-standard.md`.

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "I have a Next.js 15 app with Tailwind and Prisma. Adapt Sauron to my repo and tell me what I need."

**Output:** Audit detects Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma. Recommends `skills/workflow` (`plan-feature`, `api-endpoint-generator`, `database-migration`) and `skills/frontend/design-engineering` (`01-foundations-and-systems`). Scaffolds `projects/<project-name>/context/core-domains/product-requirements.md`, `projects/<project-name>/context/core-domains/system-architecture.md`, `projects/<project-name>/context/core-domains/database-schema.md`, and `projects/<project-name>/context/core-domains/design-system.md` with placeholder markers intact. Presents adaptation summary for approval before writing.

**Input (Existing/Brownfield Repo):** "We have an established Django and React mobile project with 50k lines of legacy code. How do we integrate Sauron without breaking our code?"

**Output:** Non-destructive audit detects Python, Django, React Native, Expo. Preserves existing codebase untouched. Recommends `skills/frontend/mobile-react-native` (`react-native-best-practices`, `expo-project-structure`) and `skills/workflow` (`testing/write-a-test`, `workflows/code-inspection`). Scaffolds `.agents/` context rules and `rules/common/general-rules.md` to enforce project safety boundaries. Requests user confirmation before writing governance files.

**Failure case:** The user says "automatically apply everything without asking me". Refuse: proceeding without user confirmation violates AP-45 and Section 6 anti-trigger thresholds. Ask for explicit approval before provisioning files.
